### **1. Basic Terminology**
- **Data**: Raw facts or figures that can be processed to produce meaningful information.
- **Data Structure**: A way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Examples: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs.
- **Program**: A set of instructions written in a programming language to perform a specific task.
- **Algorithm**: A step-by-step procedure to solve a problem or perform a computation.

---

### **2. Elementary Data Organization**
Data organization refers to how data is structured and stored in a computer. It involves:
- **Primitive Data Types**: Basic data types like integers, floats, and characters.
- **Non-Primitive Data Types**: Derived from primitive types, such as arrays, structures, and pointers.
- **File Organization**: Storing data in files, such as sequential, indexed, or hashed files.

---

### **3. Built-in Data Types in C**
C provides several built-in data types:
- **int**: For integers (e.g., `int x = 10;`).
- **char**: For single characters (e.g., `char c = 'A';`).
- **float**: For floating-point numbers (e.g., `float f = 3.14;`).
- **double**: For double-precision floating-point numbers (e.g., `double d = 3.14159;`).
- **void**: Represents the absence of a type, used in functions that do not return a value.

---

### **4. Algorithm**
An algorithm is a sequence of steps designed to solve a problem. It has:
- **Input**: Data provided to the algorithm.
- **Output**: Result produced by the algorithm.
- **Finiteness**: The algorithm must terminate after a finite number of steps.
- **Definiteness**: Each step must be precisely defined.
- **Effectiveness**: Each step must be simple and executable.

---

### **5. Efficiency of an Algorithm**
The efficiency of an algorithm is determined by:
- **Time Complexity**: How much time an algorithm takes to run as a function of input size.
- **Space Complexity**: How much memory an algorithm uses as a function of input size.

---

### **6. Time and Space Complexity**
- **Time Complexity**: Measures the number of operations the algorithm performs. Commonly expressed using Big-O notation (e.g., O(n), O(log n)).
- **Space Complexity**: Measures the amount of memory the algorithm uses. Also expressed using Big-O notation.

---

### **7. Asymptotic Notations**
Asymptotic notations describe the behavior of an algorithm as the input size approaches infinity:
- **Big Oh (O)**: Upper bound on the time complexity. Represents the worst-case scenario. Example: O(n²).
- **Big Theta (Θ)**: Tight bound on the time complexity. Represents both the upper and lower bounds. Example: Θ(n log n).
- **Big Omega (Ω)**: Lower bound on the time complexity. Represents the best-case scenario. Example: Ω(n).

---

### **8. Time-Space Trade-off**
This refers to the balance between the time and memory an algorithm uses. Often, improving time complexity increases space complexity and vice versa. For example:
- Using a hash table reduces search time but increases memory usage.
- Using a recursive algorithm saves memory but may increase execution time.

---

### **9. Abstract Data Types (ADT)**
An ADT is a mathematical model for data types, defined by its behavior (operations) rather than its implementation. Examples:
- **Stack**: Operations: push, pop, peek.
- **Queue**: Operations: enqueue, dequeue.
- **List**: Operations: insert, delete, traverse.

ADTs focus on **what** operations can be performed, not **how** they are implemented.

---

### Summary
These concepts form the foundation of computer science and programming. Understanding them is essential for designing efficient algorithms and data structures, analyzing program performance, and solving complex problems

### **1. Definition of Arrays**
An **array** is a collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations. Each element can be accessed using an index. Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable.

---

### **2. Single and Multidimensional Arrays**
- **Single-Dimensional Array (1-D)**:
  - A linear collection of elements.
  - Example: `int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};`
  - Accessed using a single index: `arr[0]` gives the first element.
- **Multidimensional Array**:
  - Arrays with more than one dimension.
  - Common types:
    - **2-D Array**: Like a matrix (rows and columns). Example: `int matrix[2][3] = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}};`
    - **3-D Array**: Like a cube (rows, columns, and depth). Example: `int cube[2][3][4];`
    - **n-D Array**: Generalized to n dimensions.

---

### **3. Representation of Arrays**
Arrays are stored in memory in either **Row Major Order** or **Column Major Order**:
- **Row Major Order**:
  - Elements are stored row by row.
  - Example for a 2-D array: `arr[2][3]` is stored as:  
    `arr[0][0], arr[0][1], arr[0][2], arr[1][0], arr[1][1], arr[1][2]`.
- **Column Major Order**:
  - Elements are stored column by column.
  - Example for a 2-D array: `arr[2][3]` is stored as:  
    `arr[0][0], arr[1][0], arr[0][1], arr[1][1], arr[0][2], arr[1][2]`.

---

### **4. Derivation of Index Formulae**
Index formulae are used to calculate the memory address of an element in an array.

#### **1-D Array**
- If the array starts at base address `Base` and each element has size `Size`:
  ```
  Address of arr[i] = Base + (i * Size)
  ```

#### **2-D Array**
- **Row Major Order**:
  ```
  Address of arr[i][j] = Base + (i * C + j) * Size
  ```
  Where:  
  - `C` = Number of columns,  
  - `i` = Row index,  
  - `j` = Column index.

- **Column Major Order**:
  ```
  Address of arr[i][j] = Base + (j * R + i) * Size
  ```
  Where:  
  - `R` = Number of rows,  
  - `i` = Row index,  
  - `j` = Column index.

#### **3-D Array**
- **Row Major Order**:
  ```
  Address of arr[i][j][k] = Base + (i * C * D + j * D + k) * Size
  ```
  Where:  
  - `C` = Number of columns,  
  - `D` = Depth,  
  - `i`, `j`, `k` = Indices.

- **Column Major Order**:
  ```
  Address of arr[i][j][k] = Base + (k * R * C + j * R + i) * Size
  ```
  Where:  
  - `R` = Number of rows,  
  - `C` = Number of columns,  
  - `i`, `j`, `k` = Indices.

Certainly! Continuing from where I left:

---

#### **n-D Array (continued)**
  Where:  
  - `S1 = C2 * C3 * ... * Cn`,  
  - `S2 = C3 * C4 * ... * Cn`,  
  - ...,  
  - `Sn-1 = Cn`,  
  - `i1, i2, ..., in` are the indices for each dimension,  
  - `C1, C2, ..., Cn` are the sizes of each dimension.

- General formula for **Column Major Order**:
  ```
  Address of arr[i1][i2][...][in] = Base + (in * S1 + i(n-1) * S2 + ... + i1) * Size
  ```
  Where:  
  - `S1 = R2 * R3 * ... * Rn`,  
  - `S2 = R3 * R4 * ... * Rn`,  
  - ...,  
  - `Sn-1 = Rn`,  
  - `i1, i2, ..., in` are the indices for each dimension,  
  - `R1, R2, ..., Rn` are the sizes of each dimension.

---

### **5. Applications of Arrays**
Arrays are widely used in programming for:
- Storing and manipulating collections of data.
- Implementing other data structures like stacks, queues, and matrices.
- Searching and sorting algorithms (e.g., Binary Search, Bubble Sort).
- Representing polynomials, strings, and graphs.

---

### **6. Sparse Matrices and Their Representations**
A **sparse matrix** is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero. Storing all elements is inefficient, so special representations are used:
- **Triplet Representation**:
  - Stores non-zero elements as triplets `(row, column, value)`.
  - Example:  
    ```
    Row:    [0, 1, 2]
    Column: [1, 2, 0]
    Value:  [3, 5, 7]
    ```
- **Compressed Sparse Row (CSR)**:
  - Uses three arrays:  
    - `Values`: Stores non-zero elements.  
    - `Column Indices`: Stores column indices of non-zero elements.  
    - `Row Pointers`: Stores the starting index of each row in the `Values` array.
  - Example:  
    ```
    Values:         [3, 5, 7]
    Column Indices: [1, 2, 0]
    Row Pointers:   [0, 1, 2, 3]
    ```
- **Compressed Sparse Column (CSC)**:
  - Similar to CSR but organized column-wise.

---

### **Summary**
- Arrays are fundamental data structures used to store and access elements efficiently.
- Single-dimensional arrays are linear, while multidimensional arrays can represent matrices, cubes, or higher-dimensional data.
- Arrays can be stored in **Row Major Order** or **Column Major Order**, and index formulae are used to calculate element addresses.
- Arrays have numerous applications, including implementing other data structures and algorithms.
- **Sparse matrices** are efficiently stored using specialized representations like Triplet, CSR, or CSC.


### **1. Linked Lists**
A **Linked List** is a linear data structure where elements (called nodes) are connected using pointers. Unlike arrays, linked lists are not stored in contiguous memory locations.

---

### **2. Implementations of Linked Lists**
#### **Array Implementation**
- Uses arrays to simulate linked lists.
- Each node contains two fields: `data` and `next` (index of the next node).
- Example:
  ```python
  MAX_SIZE = 100
  data = [None] * MAX_SIZE
  next = [-1] * MAX_SIZE
  head = -1  # Points to the first node
  ```

#### **Pointer Implementation**
- Uses pointers to create nodes dynamically.
- Each node contains two fields: `data` and `next` (pointer to the next node).
- Example (in Python):
  ```python
  class Node:
      def __init__(self, data):
          self.data = data
          self.next = None
  ```

---

### **3. Types of Linked Lists**
#### **Singly Linked List**
- Each node points to the next node.
- Example:
  ```python
  head -> Node1 -> Node2 -> Node3 -> None
  ```

#### **Doubly Linked List**
- Each node points to both the next and previous nodes.
- Example:
  ```python
  None <- Node1 <-> Node2 <-> Node3 -> None
  ```

#### **Circularly Linked List**
- The last node points back to the first node.
- Example:
  ```python
  head -> Node1 -> Node2 -> Node3 -> Node1
  ```

---

### **4. Operations on a Linked List**
#### **Insertion**
- Insert at the beginning, middle, or end of the list.
- Example (Singly Linked List):
  ```python
  def insert_at_beginning(head, data):
      new_node = Node(data)
      new_node.next = head
      head = new_node
      return head
  ```

#### **Deletion**
- Delete a node by value or position.
- Example (Singly Linked List):
  ```python
  def delete_node(head, key):
      temp = head
      if temp is not None and temp.data == key:
          head = temp.next
          return head
      while temp is not None:
          if temp.data == key:
              break
          prev = temp
          temp = temp.next
      if temp is None:
          return head
      prev.next = temp.next
      return head
  ```

#### **Traversal**
- Visit all nodes in the list.
- Example:
  ```python
  def traverse(head):
      temp = head
      while temp is not None:
          print(temp.data, end=" -> ")
          temp = temp.next
      print("None")
  ```

---

### **5. Polynomial Representation**
Polynomials can be represented using linked lists, where each node stores the coefficient and exponent of a term.

#### **Single-Variable Polynomial**
Example: `5x^3 + 2x + 7` can be represented as:
```python
head -> (5, 3) -> (2, 1) -> (7, 0) -> None
```

#### **Two-Variable Polynomial**
Example: `3x^2y + 4xy^2 + 5` can be represented as:
```python
head -> (3, 2, 1) -> (4, 1, 2) -> (5, 0, 0) -> None
```

---

### **6. Polynomial Operations**
#### **Addition**
- Add two polynomials by combining like terms.
- Example (Single-Variable):
  ```python
  def add_polynomials(p1, p2):
      result = None
      while p1 is not None and p2 is not None:
          if p1.exponent > p2.exponent:
              result = insert_at_end(result, p1.coefficient, p1.exponent)
              p1 = p1.next
          elif p1.exponent < p2.exponent:
              result = insert_at_end(result, p2.coefficient, p2.exponent)
              p2 = p2.next
          else:
              coeff = p1.coefficient + p2.coefficient
              if coeff != 0:
                  result = insert_at_end(result, coeff, p1.exponent)
              p1 = p1.next
              p2 = p2.next
      while p1 is not None:
          result = insert_at_end(result, p1.coefficient, p1.exponent)
          p1 = p1.next
      while p2 is not None:
          result = insert_at_end(result, p2.coefficient, p2.exponent)
          p2 = p2.next
      return result
  ```

#### **Subtraction**
- Subtract one polynomial from another by combining like terms.
- Similar to addition, but subtract coefficients of like terms.

#### **Multiplication**
- Multiply two polynomials by distributing terms.
- Example (Single-Variable):
  ```python
  def multiply_polynomials(p1, p2):
      result = None
      while p1 is not None:
          temp = p2
          while temp is not None:
              coeff = p1.coefficient * temp.coefficient
              exp = p1.exponent + temp.exponent
              result = insert_term(result, coeff, exp)
              temp = temp.next
          p1 = p1.next
      return result
  ```

---

### **Algorithm in the Style of Rabin-Karp**
Here’s an algorithm for **inserting a node in a singly linked list**, written in the style of your Rabin-Karp example:

```python
def insert_in_linked_list(head, data, position):
    # Create a new node with the given data
    new_node = Node(data)

    # If inserting at the beginning
    if position == 0:
        new_node.next = head
        head = new_node
        return head

    # Traverse to the position
    temp = head
    for i in range(position - 1):
        if temp is None:
            return head  # Position out of bounds
        temp = temp.next

    # Insert the new node
    new_node.next = temp.next
    temp.next = new_node

    return head  # Return the updated head
```

---

### **Summary**
- Linked lists are flexible data structures with various implementations and types.
- Common operations include insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- Linked lists are useful for representing polynomials and performing arithmetic operations.
- Algorithms can be written in a structured and concise manner to perform these operations efficiently.
