# Functional Dependency (FD) in DBMS

#### Role of FD in DBMS

1. **Normalization**:
   - **Definition**: FD helps in organizing database attributes to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
   - **Example**: If you have a table with columns `StudentID`, `StudentName`, `CourseID`, and `CourseName`, where `StudentID` uniquely determines `StudentName`, and `CourseID` uniquely determines `CourseName`, FDs help split the table to avoid redundancy.

2. **Determining Keys**:
   - **Definition**: FDs help in identifying candidate keys, which are minimal sets of attributes that can uniquely identify a tuple in a table.
   - **Example**: In a table `R(StudentID, CourseID, Grade)`, `StudentID` and `CourseID` together can uniquely identify a `Grade`, making `{StudentID, CourseID}` a candidate key.

3. **Schema Optimization**:
   - **Definition**: Using FDs, you can split a table into smaller, more efficient tables without losing data.
   - **Example**: A table with attributes `A`, `B`, and `C` where `A -> B` and `B -> C` can be split into two tables: `R1(A, B)` and `R2(B, C)`.

4. **Data Integrity**:
   - **Definition**: FDs ensure data consistency by establishing relationships between attributes.
   - **Example**: If `EmployeeID -> EmployeeName`, any change to `EmployeeName` must reflect for the corresponding `EmployeeID`, maintaining data integrity.

#### Questions: Which of the following satisfies FD?

- **Example Question**: Given a table with attributes `A`, `B`, and `C`, which of the following FDs are satisfied?
  1. `A -> B`
  2. `B -> C`
  3. `A -> C`

#### Define Functional Dependency Terms

1. **Determinant -> Dependent**:
   - **Definition**: In an FD `X -> Y`, `X` is the determinant and `Y` is the dependent.
   - **Example**: In `StudentID -> StudentName`, `StudentID` is the determinant, and `StudentName` is the dependent.

2. **Trivial FD**:
   - **Definition**: An FD `X -> Y` is trivial if `Y` is a subset of `X`.
   - **Example**: `{StudentID, StudentName} -> StudentID` is trivial.

3. **Non-Trivial FD**:
   - **Definition**: An FD `X -> Y` is non-trivial if `Y` is not a subset of `X`.
   - **Example**: `StudentID -> StudentName` is non-trivial.

#### More Questions: Which of the following satisfies FD?

- **Example**: Given a relation `R(A, B, C)` and FDs `A -> B`, `B -> C`, and `A -> C`, determine which FDs hold true based on given data.

#### Closure of Attribute

1. **Definition**: The closure of an attribute set `X`, denoted as `X+`, is the set of attributes that can be functionally determined by `X`.
2. **Finding Closure**:
   - **Step 1**: Initialize `X+` with `X`.
   - **Step 2**: For each FD `Y -> Z`, if `Y` is in `X+`, add `Z` to `X+`.
   - **Step 3**: Repeat until no more attributes can be added.

3. **Examples**:
   - **Example 1**: For `R(A, B, C, D)` with FDs `A -> B` and `B -> C`, the closure of `A` (`A+`) is `{A, B, C}`.
   - **Example 2**: For `R(A, B, C, D)` with FDs `A -> B`, `B -> C`, and `A -> D`, the closure of `A` (`A+`) is `{A, B, C, D}`.

Let's illustrate the concepts with tables.

### 1. **Normalization Example**

#### Initial Table
| StudentID | StudentName | CourseID | CourseName |
|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| 1         | Alice       | C101     | Math       |
| 2         | Bob         | C102     | Science    |
| 1         | Alice       | C102     | Science    |

- **FDs**: `StudentID -> StudentName` and `CourseID -> CourseName`.
- **Problem**: Redundancy, as `StudentName` and `CourseName` are repeated.

#### Normalized Tables

**Table 1: Students**
| StudentID | StudentName |
|-----------|-------------|
| 1         | Alice       |
| 2         | Bob         |

**Table 2: Courses**
| CourseID | CourseName |
|----------|------------|
| C101     | Math       |
| C102     | Science    |

**Table 3: Enrollments**
| StudentID | CourseID |
|-----------|----------|
| 1         | C101     |
| 2         | C102     |
| 1         | C102     |

### 2. **Determining Keys Example**

Given a relation `R(StudentID, CourseID, Grade)`:

| StudentID | CourseID | Grade |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1         | C101     | A     |
| 2         | C102     | B     |
| 1         | C102     | A     |

- **FD**: `StudentID, CourseID -> Grade`.
- **Candidate Key**: `{StudentID, CourseID}`.

### 3. **Schema Optimization Example**

#### Initial Table
| A  | B  | C  |
|----|----|----|
| a1 | b1 | c1 |
| a2 | b2 | c2 |
| a3 | b3 | c3 |

- **FDs**: `A -> B`, `B -> C`.

#### Optimized Tables

**Table 1: R1**
| A  | B  |
|----|----|
| a1 | b1 |
| a2 | b2 |
| a3 | b3 |

**Table 2: R2**
| B  | C  |
|----|----|
| b1 | c1 |
| b2 | c2 |
| b3 | c3 |

### 4. **Closure of Attribute Example**

Given relation `R(A, B, C, D)` and FDs `A -> B`, `B -> C`, `A -> D`:

- **Find `A+`**:
  1. Start with `A+ = {A}`.
  2. `A -> B`, add `B`: `A+ = {A, B}`.
  3. `B -> C`, add `C`: `A+ = {A, B, C}`.
  4. `A -> D`, add `D`: `A+ = {A, B, C, D}`

 
# Armstrong's Axiom Rules (Inference Rules) for Functional Dependency

Armstrong's axioms are a set of rules used to infer all possible functional dependencies (FDs) from a given set of FDs. These rules are sound (only infer valid FDs) and complete (can infer all valid FDs).

## Primary Rules

### 1. **Axiom of Reflexivity**
- **Definition**: If `Y` is a subset of `X`, then `X -> Y`.
- **Explanation**: Any set of attributes determines itself or any subset of itself.
- **Example**: For a set of attributes `{A, B, C}`, the FD `{A, B, C} -> {A, B}` holds true because `{A, B}` is a subset of `{A, B, C}`.

### 2. **Axiom of Augmentation (or Argumentation)**
- **Definition**: If `X -> Y`, then `XZ -> YZ` for any attribute set `Z`.
- **Explanation**: Adding the same set of attributes `Z` to both sides of a valid FD keeps the FD valid.
- **Example**: If `A -> B`, then `A, C -> B, C` is also valid.

### 3. **Axiom of Transitivity**
- **Definition**: If `X -> Y` and `Y -> Z`, then `X -> Z`.
- **Explanation**: This is similar to the transitive property in mathematics, where the FD `X -> Z` can be inferred if `X` determines `Y` and `Y` determines `Z`.
- **Example**: If `A -> B` and `B -> C`, then `A -> C`
# Secondary Rules for Functional Dependency Inference

These are additional rules derived from Armstrong's primary axioms that are useful for inferring functional dependencies.

## 1. **Union**
- **Definition**: If `X -> Y` and `X -> Z`, then `X -> YZ`.
- **Explanation**: If `X` determines both `Y` and `Z` separately, then `X` also determines their union (`YZ`).
- **Example**:  
  If `A -> B` and `A -> C`, then `A -> BC`.

#### Table Example:
| A  | B  | C  |
|----|----|----|
| a1 | b1 | c1 |
| a2 | b2 | c2 |

Given `A -> B` and `A -> C`, you can infer that `A -> BC`.

## 2. **Composition**
- **Definition**: If `X -> Y` and `Z -> W`, then `XZ -> YW`.
- **Explanation**: If `X` determines `Y` and `Z` determines `W`, then the combination of `X` and `Z` will determine the combination of `Y` and `W`.
- **Example**:  
  If `A -> B` and `C -> D`, then `AC -> BD`.

#### Table Example:
| A  | B  | C  | D  |
|----|----|----|----|
| a1 | b1 | c1 | d1 |
| a2 | b2 | c2 | d2 |

Given `A -> B` and `C -> D`, you can infer that `AC -> BD`.

## 3. **Decomposition**
- **Definition**: If `X -> YZ`, then `X -> Y` and `X -> Z`.
- **Explanation**: If `X` determines a combination of `Y` and `Z`, then `X` must also determine each of `Y` and `Z` separately.
- **Example**:  
  If `A -> BC`, then `A -> B` and `A -> C`.

#### Table Example:
| A  | B  | C  |
|----|----|----|
| a1 | b1 | c1 |
| a2 | b2 | c2 |

Given `A -> BC`, you can infer that `A -> B` and `A -> C`.

## 4. **Pseudo Transitivity**
- **Definition**: If `X -> Y` and `YZ -> W`, then `X -> W`.
- **Explanation**: If `X` determines `Y` and the combination of `Y` and `Z` determines `W`, then `X` determines `W`.
- **Example**:  
  If `A -> B` and `BC -> D`, then `A -> D`.

#### Table Example:
| A  | B  | C  | D  |
|----|----|----|----|
| a1 | b1 | c1 | d1 |
| a2 | b2 | c2 | d2 |

Given `A -> B` and `BC -> D`, you can infer that `A -> D`.

These secondary rules are derived from the primary axioms and offer powerful tools for reasoning about functional dependencies. Would you like further examples or clarifications

# Soundness and Completeness of Armstrong Axioms

## Soundness
- **Definition**: The rules of Armstrong's axioms are **sound** because they only infer valid functional dependencies. That is, if you apply the rules correctly, the resulting dependencies are guaranteed to be correct.
- **Explanation**: If a set of FDs can be derived from the axioms, it must be true in the original relation.

## Completeness
- **Definition**: The rules of Armstrong's axioms are **complete** because they can infer all valid functional dependencies. That is, if a functional dependency is true, it can be derived using the axioms.
- **Explanation**: There is no valid FD that cannot be derived using the axioms.

### Example:
- Given a set of FDs `{A -> B, B -> C}`, you can use Armstrong's axioms to derive `A -> C` through transitivity, showing both soundness and completeness.

---

# Equivalence of FD Questions

Two sets of FDs are **equivalent** if they lead to the same set of functional dependencies. The equivalence between two sets of FDs is crucial for simplifying schema design and optimization.

### Conditions for Equivalence:
1. **Set of FDs**: Two sets of FDs `{X -> Y, Y -> Z}` and `{X -> Z, Y -> Z}` are equivalent because they determine the same relationships between attributes.
2. **Logical Equivalence**: Two FDs or sets of FDs are logically equivalent if they imply each other.

### Example:
- Consider the FDs `{A -> B, B -> C}` and `{A -> C}`. These are **equivalent** because `A -> C` can be derived using Armstrong’s transitivity rule from `A -> B` and `B -> C`.

---

# Role of Axiom Rules in Database Development

## 1. **Validation of FD**
Armstrong's axioms help **validate** functional dependencies by enabling the system to:
- **Check Consistency**: Ensures the set of FDs in a schema is consistent, meaning no conflicting dependencies exist.
- **Check Implications**: Validates whether a proposed FD is implied by the existing set of FDs in the database schema.

### Example:
- If you have `{A -> B, B -> C}` and want to check if `A -> C` holds, you can use the transitivity rule to confirm that `A -> C` is valid.

## 2. **Normalize Process**
- **Definition**: Armstrong’s axioms are used in the normalization process, where FDs are used to break down complex tables into simpler, non-redundant tables.
- **Purpose**: Ensures that functional dependencies are properly handled, reducing redundancy, and avoiding update anomalies in the database.
  
### Example:
- In 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, and BCNF, FDs are used to decide how to decompose relations into smaller ones, ensuring that attributes are dependent only on the primary key and removing transitive dependencies.

## 3. **Schema Optimization**
- **Definition**: Axiom rules help in **schema optimization** by providing methods to efficiently manage relations and their dependencies. Optimizing schemas based on FDs can reduce redundancy, enhance performance, and ensure data integrity.
- **Purpose**: Optimizing a schema ensures that there is minimal duplication of data and that the database is efficient in storage and retrieval.

### Example:
- When working with a schema that has many redundant columns, applying Armstrong’s axioms like **Union** or **Decomposition** helps split or combine tables, improving query performance and reducing data redundancy.

---

### Summary of the Role:
- **Validation of FD**: Ensures that FDs are logically valid and consistent with the database structure.
- **Normalization**: Helps break down complex relations, ensuring minimal redundancy and avoiding update anomalies.
- **Schema Optimization**: Optimizes the database schema to improve storage efficiency and retrieval speed.

  # Minimal Cover in Functional Dependencies

A **Minimal Cover** is a set of functional dependencies that is equivalent to a given set of FDs but is as small as possible. This means that the minimal cover contains no extraneous dependencies or attributes, and all FDs are necessary to maintain the same functional relationships.

## Steps to Find Minimal Cover

### 1. **Make the right-hand side of each FD a singleton**  
- For every functional dependency, if the right-hand side (RHS) contains more than one attribute, split it into separate FDs with a single attribute on the RHS.
- **Example**:  
  If `A -> BC`, split it into:
  - `A -> B`
  - `A -> C`

### 2. **Remove extraneous attributes from the left-hand side**  
- If an attribute on the left-hand side (LHS) of an FD is redundant (i.e., it is not necessary for the FD to hold), remove it.
- **Example**:  
  If `AB -> C` and `A -> C`, then `A -> C` makes `AB -> C` redundant, so remove it.

### 3. **Remove redundant FDs**  
- After applying steps 1 and 2, check if any FD is redundant (i.e., can be derived from the others). Remove redundant FDs.
- **Example**:  
  If `A -> B`, `B -> C`, and `A -> C` are in the set of FDs, and `A -> B` and `B -> C` imply `A -> C`, then `A -> C` is redundant and should be removed.

### Example of Minimal Cover:

Given FDs:  
- `A -> BC`
- `AB -> C`
- `A -> C`

### Steps:
1. Split RHS of FDs:
   - `A -> B`
   - `A -> C`
   - `AB -> C`
2. Remove extraneous attributes:
   - `AB -> C` can be reduced to `A -> C` (since `A -> C` is already present).
3. Remove redundant FDs:
   - `A -> C` is redundant (as it's already derived from `A -> B` and `B -> C`).

### Minimal Cover:  
- `A -> B`
- `A -> C`

---

# Canonical Cover

A **Canonical Cover** is a minimal set of functional dependencies that preserves all the information of the original set, with no extraneous dependencies or attributes.

## Procedure of Canonical Cover

### 1. **Reduction**  
- **Definition**: Involves removing any unnecessary attributes from the left-hand side (LHS) of a functional dependency. If removing an attribute from the LHS doesn't change the closure, it's unnecessary.
- **Example**:  
  Given `AB -> C`, and `A -> C`, we can reduce `AB -> C` to `A -> C`.

### 2. **Elimination**  
- **Definition**: Eliminate redundant FDs from the set. If a dependency can be derived from the others, it is redundant and can be removed.
- **Example**:  
  Given `A -> B`, `B -> C`, and `A -> C`, if `A -> B` and `B -> C` imply `A -> C`, then `A -> C` can be eliminated as redundant.

### 3. **Minimization**  
- **Definition**: This step involves minimizing the set of functional dependencies by ensuring each FD is as simple as possible while still preserving the same functional relationships.
- **Example**:  
  If `A -> BC` is a dependency, you can minimize it to `A -> B` and `A -> C` since each FD is simpler.

---

### Questions Related to Minimal Cover

1. **Which of the following sets is a minimal cover for the given set of FDs?**
   - You may be given a set of FDs and asked to determine the minimal cover by applying the reduction, elimination, and minimization steps.
   
2. **How do you minimize a given set of functional dependencies?**
   - This question requires you to apply the steps of canonical cover to find the minimal set.

3. **Given a set of FDs, find the canonical cover.**
   - Apply all the reduction, elimination, and minimization procedures to get the canonical cover.

---

### Example of Canonical Cover

Given FDs:
- `AB -> C`
- `A -> B`
- `B -> C`

### Steps to Find Canonical Cover:

1. **Reduction**:  
   - `AB -> C` cannot be reduced further because removing either `A` or `B` results in an incomplete FD. No changes here.

2. **Elimination**:  
   - Since `A -> B` and `B -> C` imply `A -> C`, we can eliminate `A -> C`.

3. **Minimization**:  
   - FDs remain the same after elimination.

**Canonical Cover**:  
- `A -> B`
- `B -> C`

This is the minimal, canonical set of functional dependencies

# Prime Attribute of R

In the context of relational databases, a **Prime Attribute** is an attribute that is part of at least one **candidate key** of a relation.

## Explanation
- **Candidate Key**: A minimal set of attributes that uniquely identify a tuple (record) in a relation.
- **Prime Attribute**: If an attribute is a part of any candidate key, it is termed a **prime attribute**.

## Example:
Consider a relation **R** with attributes `{A, B, C, D}` and the following set of candidate keys:
- `{A, B}`
- `{B, C}`

### In this case:
- **Prime Attributes**: `A`, `B`, `C` (since all these attributes are part of the candidate keys).
- **Non-Prime Attribute**: `D` (since it is not part of any candidate key).

Prime attributes are crucial when discussing **normalization**, as they help define which attributes can be involved in functional dependencies and which can be considered non-redundant for normalization purposes

# Candidate Keys

A **Candidate Key** is a minimal set of attributes that can uniquely identify a tuple in a relation. This means:
- A candidate key is a **minimal superkey**.
- Every attribute in the candidate key is necessary, i.e., removing any attribute would make it unable to uniquely identify the tuple.

## Steps to Find Candidate Keys

### 1. **Find the Closure of each combination of attributes**  
To determine if a set of attributes can function as a candidate key, calculate the **closure** of that set (the set of attributes that can be functionally determined by the set).

### 2. **Check for Uniqueness**  
A set of attributes is a candidate key if the closure of that set contains all the attributes in the relation. If it does, the set can uniquely identify tuples in the relation.

### 3. **Minimality**  
Among all possible superkeys, only the minimal ones are candidate keys. Ensure the set is minimal, meaning no subset of the set can uniquely identify tuples.

### Example:
Consider the relation **R(A, B, C, D)** with the following functional dependencies:
- `A -> B`
- `B -> C`
- `C -> D`

#### Steps:
1. **Find Closure of {A}**:
   - `{A} -> {A, B} -> {A, B, C} -> {A, B, C, D}`
   - The closure of `{A}` contains all attributes (`A, B, C, D`), so `{A}` is a candidate key.

2. **Find Closure of {B}**:
   - `{B} -> {B, C} -> {B, C, D}`
   - The closure of `{B}` does not contain `A`, so `{B}` is not a candidate key.

Thus, the **candidate key** for this relation is `{A}`.

---

# Find Canonical Cover

A **Canonical Cover** (also called **Minimal Cover**) of a set of functional dependencies is a minimal set of FDs that is logically equivalent to the original set, but with no redundancy.

## Steps to Find Canonical Cover

### 1. **Make each FD have a single attribute on the RHS**  
If the RHS of any functional dependency has more than one attribute, decompose it into multiple FDs with a single attribute on the RHS.

### 2. **Remove extraneous attributes from the LHS**  
Check if any attribute in the LHS of a functional dependency is redundant. If removing it doesn't change the closure of the FD, then it’s extraneous and can be removed.

### 3. **Remove redundant functional dependencies**  
If an FD can be derived from others in the set, it is redundant and should be removed.

### Example:
Given the FDs:
- `AB -> C`
- `A -> B`
- `B -> C`

#### Steps:
1. **Make each FD have a single attribute on the RHS**:
   - No change needed because all FDs already have a single attribute on the RHS.

2. **Remove extraneous attributes from the LHS**:
   - `AB -> C` can be reduced to `A -> C` because `A -> B` and `B -> C` imply `A -> C`.

3. **Remove redundant FDs**:
   - After reducing `AB -> C` to `A -> C`, the set of FDs becomes:
     - `A -> B`
     - `B -> C`
     - `A -> C`
   - The FD `A -> C` is redundant because it can be derived from `A -> B` and `B -> C`.

Thus, the **canonical cover** is:
- `A -> B`
- `B -> C`

---

# Example Question: Find Candidate Keys and Canonical Cover

Given the relation **R(A, B, C, D)** and the following FDs:
- `A -> B`
- `B -> C`
- `A -> D`
- `C -> D`

### 1. **Find the Candidate Keys**:

- Calculate the closure of various attribute sets:
  - **{A}**: `{A} -> {A, B} -> {A, B, C} -> {A, B, C, D}`
  - **{A, B}**: `{A, B} -> {A, B, C} -> {A, B, C, D}`
  - **{B}**: `{B} -> {B, C} -> {B, C, D}` (Doesn't include `A`)

Thus, **{A}** is a candidate key.

### 2. **Find the Canonical Cover**:
- Given FDs:
  - `A -> B`
  - `B -> C`
  - `A -> D`
  - `C -> D`

  Steps:
  1. No need to decompose RHS.
  2. Remove extraneous attributes:
     - `A -> D` and `C -> D` cannot be simplified further.
  3. Remove redundant FDs:
     - All the FDs are needed to cover the relations.

The **canonical cover** remains:
- `A -> B`
- `B -> C`
- `A -> D`
- `C -> D`


# Normalization

Normalization is the process of organizing a relational database to reduce redundancy and dependency by dividing larger tables into smaller, more manageable ones. It ensures that the database structure is efficient and flexible.

## Need for Normalization

### 1. **Reduced Data Redundancy**
- **Explanation**: By splitting large tables into smaller ones, we eliminate unnecessary duplication of data. Each piece of information is stored only once, making the database more efficient and reducing the size.
- **Example**:  
  Instead of storing the customer's address with each order, you store the address in a separate table and link it to the order through a foreign key. This avoids storing the same address multiple times.

### 2. **Improve Data Integrity**
- **Explanation**: Normalization ensures that the data is consistent and accurately reflects the relationships between different entities. By removing redundancy, the risk of data anomalies (such as inconsistent updates) is minimized.
- **Example**:  
  If a customer's address is stored in only one place, you can ensure that it’s updated consistently across the system when the customer moves.

### 3. **Simplify Maintenance**
- **Explanation**: A well-normalized database is easier to maintain and update because changes in data only need to be made in one place. This simplifies tasks like adding, modifying, or deleting records.
- **Example**:  
  If a product's price changes, you only need to update the price in one location, rather than multiple places where that product appears.

---

# Redundancy

**Redundancy** occurs when the same data is stored in multiple places within a database. This can lead to various problems like increased storage requirements and data anomalies. Normalization reduces redundancy by ensuring that each piece of information is stored only once.

### Example:
- Storing the same customer information with each order in a table is redundant. Normalization would store customer info in a separate customer table, reducing redundancy.

---

# Anomalies in Database

### 1. **Insertion Anomaly**
- **Definition**: Occurs when the database structure does not allow for the insertion of data without requiring the inclusion of additional, unnecessary information.
- **Example**:  
  In a table that stores customer orders, if a new customer hasn’t placed any orders yet, it would be impossible to add their information without creating a fake order entry. This is an insertion anomaly.
  
### 2. **Deletion Anomaly**
- **Definition**: Occurs when the deletion of data leads to the loss of other important data. In a poorly designed database, deleting a record can inadvertently remove useful information.
- **Example**:  
  In a table where customer information and orders are stored together, deleting an order could accidentally delete the entire customer’s information if there are no other orders associated with that customer.

---

### Summary
- **Normalization** helps by reducing redundancy, improving data integrity, and simplifying database maintenance.
- **Redundancy** and anomalies such as **insertion** and **deletion anomalies** arise from poorly designed databases and are mitigated by the normalization process

# Normal Forms (NF)

Normalization involves organizing the data in a relational database to minimize redundancy and avoid undesirable characteristics such as anomalies. Different levels of normalization are called **Normal Forms** (NF), and each has a set of criteria that a database must satisfy.

---

## 1NF (First Normal Form)

### Criteria:
- Each table cell must contain **only one value** (atomic).
- Each record (row) must be unique.
- Attributes should contain only **single values**; no repeating groups or arrays.

### Example:
**Unnormalized Table**:

| Student_ID | Name    | Subjects                   |
|------------|---------|----------------------------|
| 1          | John    | Math, English              |
| 2          | Alice   | Science, History, Math     |

This violates 1NF because the **Subjects** column contains multiple values.

**1NF Table**:

| Student_ID | Name    | Subject     |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| 1          | John    | Math        |
| 1          | John    | English     |
| 2          | Alice   | Science     |
| 2          | Alice   | History     |
| 2          | Alice   | Math        |

Now each cell contains only atomic values.

---

## 2NF (Second Normal Form)

### Criteria:
- The table must first satisfy **1NF**.
- **No partial dependency**: All non-prime attributes (attributes not part of the candidate key) must be fully dependent on the entire candidate key, not just a part of it.

### Example:
**Table in 1NF**:

| Student_ID | Course_ID | Instructor | Instructor_Phone |
|------------|-----------|------------|------------------|
| 1          | CS101     | Dr. Smith  | 1234567890       |
| 1          | CS102     | Dr. Brown  | 9876543210       |
| 2          | CS101     | Dr. Smith  | 1234567890       |

Here, `Instructor_Phone` is dependent on `Instructor`, but not on the entire composite key (`Student_ID`, `Course_ID`). This is a **partial dependency**.

**2NF Table**:
Separate the instructor's information:

- **Student_Course Table**:
  | Student_ID | Course_ID |
  |------------|-----------|
  | 1          | CS101     |
  | 1          | CS102     |
  | 2          | CS101     |

- **Instructor Table**:
  | Instructor  | Instructor_Phone |
  |-------------|------------------|
  | Dr. Smith   | 1234567890       |
  | Dr. Brown   | 9876543210       |

Now, there is no partial dependency, satisfying 2NF.

---

## 3NF (Third Normal Form)

### Criteria:
- The table must first satisfy **2NF**.
- **No transitive dependency**: Non-prime attributes should not depend on other non-prime attributes.

### Example:
**Table in 2NF**:

| Student_ID | Course_ID | Instructor | Instructor_Phone | Instructor_Department |
|------------|-----------|------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| 1          | CS101     | Dr. Smith  | 1234567890       | Computer Science      |
| 1          | CS102     | Dr. Brown  | 9876543210       | Mathematics           |
| 2          | CS101     | Dr. Smith  | 1234567890       | Computer Science      |

Here, `Instructor_Phone` and `Instructor_Department` depend on `Instructor`, which is a non-prime attribute. This is a **transitive dependency**.

**3NF Table**:

- **Student_Course Table**:
  | Student_ID | Course_ID |
  |------------|-----------|
  | 1          | CS101     |
  | 1          | CS102     |
  | 2          | CS101     |

- **Instructor Table**:
  | Instructor  | Instructor_Phone | Instructor_Department |
  |-------------|------------------|-----------------------|
  | Dr. Smith   | 1234567890       | Computer Science      |
  | Dr. Brown   | 9876543210       | Mathematics           |

Now, there are no transitive dependencies.

---

## BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)

### Criteria:
- The table must first satisfy **3NF**.
- For every functional dependency, the left-hand side (LHS) must be a **superkey**.

### Example:
**Table in 3NF**:

| Student_ID | Course_ID | Instructor | Instructor_Phone |
|------------|-----------|------------|------------------|
| 1          | CS101     | Dr. Smith  | 1234567890       |
| 2          | CS102     | Dr. Brown  | 9876543210       |

Here, `Instructor -> Instructor_Phone` violates BCNF because `Instructor` is not a superkey.

**BCNF Table**:

- **Student_Course Table**:
  | Student_ID | Course_ID |
  |------------|-----------|
  | 1          | CS101     |
  | 2          | CS102     |

- **Instructor Table**:
  | Instructor  | Instructor_Phone |
  |-------------|------------------|
  | Dr. Smith   | 1234567890       |
  | Dr. Brown   | 9876543210       |

Now, `Instructor` is a superkey, satisfying BCNF.

---

## 4NF (Fourth Normal Form)

### Criteria:
- The table must first satisfy **BCNF**.
- **No multi-valued dependencies**: A multi-valued dependency occurs when one attribute determines multiple values of another attribute, and each value is independent of the others.

### Example:
**Table in BCNF**:

| Student_ID | Language  | Sports     |
|------------|-----------|------------|
| 1          | English  | Basketball |
| 1          | French   | Football   |

This table violates **4NF** because `Student_ID` determines multiple values for both `Language` and `Sports`, creating a **multi-valued dependency**.

**4NF Table**:

- **Student_Language Table**:
  | Student_ID | Language  |
  |------------|-----------|
  | 1          | English   |
  | 1          | French    |

- **Student_Sports Table**:
  | Student_ID | Sports    |
  |------------|-----------|
  | 1          | Basketball|
  | 1          | Football  |

Now, the multi-valued dependency is eliminated, satisfying 4NF.

---

## Normal Test and Remedy

### Normal Test:
To determine the normal form of a database, check if it satisfies the criteria of each normal form in sequence:
1. Start with 1NF.
2. Check if it satisfies 2NF, 3NF, BCNF, etc.
3. If it violates any condition, apply remedies such as decomposing tables.

### Remedy:
If a table violates any normal form, you can:
- **Decompose** the table into smaller tables while preserving the relationships between them.
- **Remove dependencies**: Eliminate partial, transitive, or multi-valued dependencies by separating attributes into different tables.

---

### Summary of Normal Forms:
- **1NF**: Ensures atomicity and no repeating groups.
- **2NF**: Eliminates partial dependencies.
- **3NF**: Eliminates transitive dependencies.
- **BCNF**: Every determinant must be a superkey.
- **4NF**: No multi-valued dependencies

# Normal Test

A **Normal Test** is a process to determine whether a relational database is in a specific normal form. It involves checking whether the database meets the criteria for the different levels of normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF, etc.). If a table doesn't meet the criteria, it's considered **not normalized**, and you can apply **normal remedies**.

### Steps for Normal Test:
1. **Start with 1NF**:  
   Check if all attributes have atomic values and there are no repeating groups. If not, convert the table into 1NF.

2. **Check for 2NF**:  
   Ensure that the table is in 1NF and that there are no partial dependencies (i.e., all non-prime attributes depend on the entire candidate key, not just part of it). If partial dependencies exist, decompose the table to move to 2NF.

3. **Check for 3NF**:  
   The table should be in 2NF, and there should be no transitive dependencies. Non-prime attributes must not depend on other non-prime attributes. If transitive dependencies exist, decompose the table to achieve 3NF.

4. **Check for BCNF**:  
   The table should be in 3NF, and for every functional dependency, the left-hand side (determinant) must be a superkey. If not, decompose the table to achieve BCNF.

5. **Check for 4NF**:  
   The table should be in BCNF, and there should be no multi-valued dependencies. If multi-valued dependencies exist, split the table to achieve 4NF.

---

# Normal Remedy

A **Normal Remedy** refers to the steps taken to normalize a database when it doesn't satisfy a certain normal form. These steps usually involve **decomposing tables** into smaller, more manageable ones, while maintaining the relationships between the data.

### Common Remedies for Violating Normal Forms:

1. **Decompose the table**:  
   If the table violates a normal form, break it into multiple smaller tables that each meet the normal form’s criteria. Each decomposed table will have a set of attributes that are functionally dependent on the candidate key.

2. **Remove partial dependencies** (for 2NF):  
   If the table violates 2NF due to partial dependency (i.e., non-prime attributes depending only on part of a composite key), decompose the table into separate tables that isolate partial dependencies.

3. **Remove transitive dependencies** (for 3NF):  
   If the table violates 3NF due to transitive dependencies (non-prime attributes depending on other non-prime attributes), decompose the table so that each non-prime attribute depends only on the primary key.

4. **Ensure superkeys** (for BCNF):  
   If the table violates BCNF (i.e., non-superkey attributes determine other attributes), decompose the table so that every determinant is a superkey.

5. **Eliminate multi-valued dependencies** (for 4NF):  
   If the table violates 4NF, separate the attributes that are dependent on multiple values into different tables to eliminate multi-valued dependencies.

---

### Example of a Normal Test and Remedy:

**Given Table:**
| Student_ID | Course_ID | Instructor | Instructor_Phone | Instructor_Department |
|------------|-----------|------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| 1          | CS101     | Dr. Smith  | 1234567890       | CS                   |
| 2          | CS102     | Dr. Brown  | 9876543210       | Math                 |
| 3          | CS101     | Dr. Smith  | 1234567890       | CS                   |

**Step 1: Check for 1NF**  
- The table is in **1NF** because each column has atomic values (no multi-valued or repeating groups).

**Step 2: Check for 2NF**  
- The table is **not in 2NF** because there’s a **partial dependency**. `Instructor_Phone` and `Instructor_Department` depend on `Instructor`, not the entire composite key (`Student_ID`, `Course_ID`).

**Remedy for 2NF**:  
Decompose the table into two smaller tables:
- **Student_Course Table**:
  | Student_ID | Course_ID |
  |------------|-----------|
  | 1          | CS101     |
  | 2          | CS102     |
  | 3          | CS101     |

- **Instructor Table**:
  | Instructor | Instructor_Phone | Instructor_Department |
  |------------|------------------|-----------------------|
  | Dr. Smith  | 1234567890       | CS                    |
  | Dr. Brown  | 9876543210       | Math                  |

**Step 3: Check for 3NF**  
- The tables are in **3NF**, because there are no transitive dependencies. Non-prime attributes (like `Instructor_Phone` and `Instructor_Department`) depend only on the primary key of the `Instructor` table.

**Step 4: Check for BCNF**  
- The tables are in **BCNF**, because every determinant (e.g., `Instructor`) is a superkey in the tables.

**Step 5: Check for 4NF**  
- The tables are in **4NF**, because there are no multi-valued dependencies. Each attribute is fully dependent on the primary key


# Conversion from nNF to mNF

Converting from one normal form (nNF) to another (mNF) involves applying a series of steps to eliminate redundancy, partial dependencies, transitive dependencies, and other issues. This process is done to achieve a higher level of normalization and ensure data integrity, reduce anomalies, and improve efficiency.

---

## 1NF → 2NF

### Steps to Convert from **1NF** to **2NF**:
1. **Check for Partial Dependencies**:
   - Ensure that every non-prime attribute (an attribute that is not part of a candidate key) is fully dependent on the entire candidate key. If a non-prime attribute is dependent on only part of a composite key, it violates 2NF.
   
2. **Remove Partial Dependencies**:
   - If partial dependencies exist, decompose the table into smaller tables:
     - The first table will contain the attributes that fully depend on the composite key.
     - The second table will contain the attributes that depend on part of the composite key, separating them into their own table with a new foreign key.

### Example:

**1NF Table** (with partial dependency):

| Student_ID | Course_ID | Instructor | Instructor_Phone |
|------------|-----------|------------|------------------|
| 1          | CS101     | Dr. Smith  | 1234567890       |
| 1          | CS102     | Dr. Brown  | 9876543210       |
| 2          | CS101     | Dr. Smith  | 1234567890       |

- Here, the primary key is a composite of `Student_ID` and `Course_ID`, but `Instructor_Phone` depends only on `Instructor`, not the whole composite key.

**Converted to 2NF** (removing partial dependency):

- **Student_Course Table**:
  | Student_ID | Course_ID |
  |------------|-----------|
  | 1          | CS101     |
  | 1          | CS102     |
  | 2          | CS101     |

- **Instructor Table**:
  | Instructor | Instructor_Phone |
  |------------|------------------|
  | Dr. Smith  | 1234567890       |
  | Dr. Brown  | 9876543210       |

---

## 2NF → 3NF

### Steps to Convert from **2NF** to **3NF**:
1. **Check for Transitive Dependencies**:
   - A table is in 2NF but not in 3NF if non-prime attributes depend on other non-prime attributes. This is called a **transitive dependency**.
   
2. **Remove Transitive Dependencies**:
   - To remove transitive dependencies, decompose the table by moving the dependent attributes into a new table where they depend directly on a key.
   
### Example:

**2NF Table** (with transitive dependency):

| Student_ID | Course_ID | Instructor | Instructor_Phone | Instructor_Department |
|------------|-----------|------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| 1          | CS101     | Dr. Smith  | 1234567890       | CS                    |
| 2          | CS102     | Dr. Brown  | 9876543210       | Math                  |
| 3          | CS101     | Dr. Smith  | 1234567890       | CS                    |

- Here, `Instructor_Department` depends on `Instructor`, not the primary key. This is a transitive dependency.

**Converted to 3NF** (removing transitive dependency):

- **Student_Course Table**:
  | Student_ID | Course_ID |
  |------------|-----------|
  | 1          | CS101     |
  | 2          | CS102     |
  | 3          | CS101     |

- **Instructor Table**:
  | Instructor | Instructor_Phone | Instructor_Department |
  |------------|------------------|-----------------------|
  | Dr. Smith  | 1234567890       | CS                    |
  | Dr. Brown  | 9876543210       | Math                  |

---

## 3NF → BCNF

### Steps to Convert from **3NF** to **BCNF**:
1. **Check for Superkey Violations**:
   - A table is in 3NF but not in BCNF if there exists a functional dependency where the determinant (the attribute that determines other attributes) is not a superkey.

2. **Remove Violations**:
   - Decompose the table by making sure that every determinant is a superkey. If a non-superkey is a determinant, create a new table for that determinant and move the dependent attributes into it.

### Example:

**3NF Table** (with BCNF violation):

| Student_ID | Course_ID | Instructor | Instructor_Phone |
|------------|-----------|------------|------------------|
| 1          | CS101     | Dr. Smith  | 1234567890       |
| 2          | CS102     | Dr. Brown  | 9876543210       |

- `Instructor -> Instructor_Phone` violates BCNF because `Instructor` is not a superkey (it does not uniquely identify the rows).

**Converted to BCNF** (ensuring superkey determinancy):

- **Student_Course Table**:
  | Student_ID | Course_ID |
  |------------|-----------|
  | 1          | CS101     |
  | 2          | CS102     |

- **Instructor Table**:
  | Instructor | Instructor_Phone |
  |------------|------------------|
  | Dr. Smith  | 1234567890       |
  | Dr. Brown  | 9876543210       |

Now, `Instructor` is a superkey in the `Instructor` table.

## Questions on Conversion

1. **Which step should you take when converting a 1NF table to a 2NF table?**
   - Answer: Identify and remove **partial dependencies**.

2. **What is a transitive dependency, and how is it resolved when converting from 2NF to 3NF?**
   - Answer: A transitive dependency occurs when a non-prime attribute depends on another non-prime attribute. To resolve it, create a new table to store the dependent attributes.

3. **What is the difference between 3NF and BCNF?**
   - Answer: In 3NF, non-prime attributes are only dependent on the primary key, while in BCNF, every determinant (attribute that determines other attributes) must be a superkey.

4. **When should you decompose a table into multiple tables in normalization?**
   - Answer: Decompose when a table violates a normal form (due to partial, transitive, or multi-valued dependencies), to eliminate redundancy and improve data integrity.

---

### Summary of Conversions:
- **1NF to 2NF**: Remove partial dependencies.
- **2NF to 3NF**: Remove transitive dependencies.
- **3NF to BCNF**: Ensure every determinant is a superkey.



---

### Summary:
- **Normal Test** involves checking if a table satisfies the criteria for each normal form (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF, 4NF).
- **Normal Remedy** involves decomposing the table to remove anomalies and meet the required normal form criteria


To determine which normal form a relation is in, we need to check if the given relation satisfies the conditions of each normal form (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF, etc.). Let's go through the steps systematically for the example relation **R(A, B, C)** with the functional dependency **A → BC**.

---

### Example: **R(A, B, C)**

#### Given Functional Dependency:
- **A → BC**: This means that attribute **A** determines attributes **B** and **C**.

### Step 1: Check if the table is in **1NF (First Normal Form)**

A table is in **1NF** if:
- All attributes contain **atomic values** (no multi-valued attributes or repeating groups).
- Each row is unique.

For **R(A, B, C)**, assuming that the values in the columns are atomic and there are no repeating groups, the table **can be considered in 1NF**.

### Step 2: Check if the table is in **2NF (Second Normal Form)**

A table is in **2NF** if:
- It is in **1NF**.
- There are **no partial dependencies** (i.e., no non-prime attribute is dependent on only a part of a composite primary key).

**Step for 2NF:**
- If we assume **A** as the candidate key (since **A → BC** and there’s no other information provided), we do not have a composite primary key, so there are no partial dependencies.
- All non-prime attributes (**B**, **C**) depend entirely on **A**, which is the primary key.

Hence, **R(A, B, C)** **satisfies 2NF**.

### Step 3: Check if the table is in **3NF (Third Normal Form)**

A table is in **3NF** if:
- It is in **2NF**.
- There are **no transitive dependencies** (i.e., no non-prime attribute depends on another non-prime attribute).

**Step for 3NF:**
- **A → BC** shows that **A** is determining both **B** and **C** directly, and there are no non-prime attributes depending on each other.
- Since **A** is the candidate key, there are **no transitive dependencies**.

Thus, **R(A, B, C)** **satisfies 3NF**.

### Step 4: Check if the table is in **BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)**

A table is in **BCNF** if:
- It is in **3NF**.
- For every functional dependency **X → Y**, **X** must be a **superkey**.

**Step for BCNF:**
- In the functional dependency **A → BC**, **A** is the **superkey** since it determines all attributes in the relation.
- Hence, the table **satisfies BCNF**.

---

### Conclusion:
Given the functional dependency **A → BC**, the relation **R(A, B, C)**:
- Is in **1NF** (assuming atomic values).
- Is in **2NF** (no partial dependencies).
- Is in **3NF** (no transitive dependencies).
- **Satisfies BCNF** (since **A** is a superkey).

Thus, **R(A, B, C)** is in **BCNF**.

---

### Example of Other Questions

1. **R(A, B, C, D)** with the functional dependencies:
   - **A → B**
   - **B → C**
   - **C → D**

- Here, **A → B**, **B → C**, and **C → D** form a chain. The candidate key would likely be **A**, and there are no transitive dependencies, but we'd need to check carefully for partial dependencies.

2. **R(A, B, C)** with functional dependency:
   - **A → BC**
   - **B → A**
   - **C → B**

- This scenario creates a loop, and we'd need to check for redundancy and cycles to determine the normal form

Here are some more questions that can help you assess the normal form of a given relation based on functional dependencies:

### Lossless Decomposition (Detailed Explanation)

**Lossless decomposition** is a critical concept in database design, particularly when normalizing relations. It ensures that when we break a large relation into smaller sub-relations, we can still retrieve the original relation without losing any information.

#### Criteria for Lossless Decomposition:
A decomposition of a relation **R** into two or more sub-relations **R1**, **R2**, ..., **Rn** is **lossless** if the following condition holds:

1. **Intersection of Relations**:
   - The intersection of the sets of attributes in the sub-relations (i.e., the common attributes between them) must be able to **identify** the original relation when the sub-relations are joined.
   
2. **Key-based Condition**:
   - For the decomposition to be lossless, the **intersection** of the sub-relations must contain a **candidate key** for at least one of the sub-relations.

Mathematically, if we decompose a relation **R(A1, A2, ..., An)** into sub-relations **R1** and **R2**:
- **R1(A1, A2, ..., Ak)** and **R2(Ak, Ak+1, ..., An)**.
  
For a **lossless decomposition**:
- The **intersection of attributes** (i.e., **Ak**) between **R1** and **R2** must be a **superkey** for at least one of the sub-relations (either **R1** or **R2**).

#### Why is it Important?
Lossless decomposition is crucial because when a relation is decomposed into smaller sub-relations, the ability to **reconstruct** the original relation (using joins) ensures that no information is lost. This is essential for data consistency and accuracy in databases.

#### Example of Lossless Decomposition:

Let's decompose the relation **R(A, B, C)** with the functional dependency **A → BC**.

- **Original Relation:** **R(A, B, C)**
- Functional Dependency: **A → BC**
- Candidate Key: **A** (since **A → BC**, and **A** is sufficient to uniquely identify each tuple).

Now, we decompose **R(A, B, C)** into two sub-relations:
- **R1(A, B)**
- **R2(A, C)**

##### Verification of Lossless Decomposition:
- The intersection of **R1** and **R2** is **A**.
- Since **A** is a **candidate key** (it uniquely identifies the rows), the decomposition is **lossless**.

When we perform a **natural join** on **R1(A, B)** and **R2(A, C)**, we can recover the original relation **R(A, B, C)** without any loss of data.

### Transitive Dependencies (Detailed Explanation)

A **transitive dependency** is a type of **functional dependency** that occurs when one non-prime attribute depends on another non-prime attribute via a third attribute. This leads to indirect dependencies, where the relationship between attributes is not direct.

#### Definition:
In a relation, if there are three attributes **X**, **Y**, and **Z**, then a **transitive dependency** occurs if:
- **X → Y** and **Y → Z**,
- Implies **X → Z**.

This means **X** indirectly determines **Z** through **Y**.

#### Key Points:
- **X** and **Z** are non-prime attributes (they do not form part of a candidate key).
- **Y** is a non-prime attribute that determines **Z**.

#### Example of Transitive Dependency:
Consider the relation **R(A, B, C, D)** with the following functional dependencies:
- **A → B** (A determines B)
- **B → C** (B determines C)
- **A → D** (A determines D)

Now, let's see the transitive dependency here:
- From **A → B** and **B → C**, we can infer **A → C**.
- This creates a transitive dependency where **A** indirectly determines **C** through **B**.

#### Why Transitive Dependencies are a Problem:
Transitive dependencies cause **redundancy** and **anomalies**:
- **Redundancy**: The same information gets stored in multiple places, leading to excessive use of storage.
- **Update Anomalies**: If data changes in one place, it might require multiple updates in different places, leading to inconsistencies.
- **Insertion Anomalies**: Inserting data can require inserting unnecessary information.
- **Deletion Anomalies**: Deleting data might result in losing useful information.

#### Removal of Transitive Dependencies (via 3NF):
To remove transitive dependencies, we use **3NF (Third Normal Form)**. A relation is in **3NF** if:
- It is in **2NF**.
- No non-prime attribute is transitively dependent on any candidate key.

To achieve **3NF**, we decompose the relation into smaller sub-relations to eliminate these transitive dependencies.

#### Example of Removing Transitive Dependencies:
Consider the relation **R(A, B, C, D)** with the following functional dependencies:
- **A → B**
- **B → C**
- **A → D**

Here, **A → C** is a transitive dependency because **A → B** and **B → C**, leading to **A → C**.

**To remove the transitive dependency:**

- Decompose the relation into:
  - **R1(A, B)**
  - **R2(B, C)**
  - **R3(A, D)**

- Now, each table contains only direct dependencies, and **R2** eliminates the transitive dependency between **A** and **C**.

---

### Summary:
- **Lossless Decomposition** ensures that the original relation can be reconstructed from its decomposed relations without any loss of data. The decomposition is lossless if the intersection of the sub-relations contains a candidate key.
- **Transitive Dependencies** occur when a non-prime attribute depends on another non-prime attribute through a third attribute. These dependencies are problematic because they lead to redundancy and anomalies. Removing them is crucial for achieving higher normal forms, like **3NF**.
