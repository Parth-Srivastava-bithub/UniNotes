# Stream Computing

**Stream Computing** is the real-time processing of continuously generated data streams, enabling instant analysis and decision-making. It differs from batch processing by handling data as it arrives, offering immediate insights and actions.

#### Key Characteristics
- **Real-Time Processing**: Processes data instantly upon arrival.
- **Scalability**: Easily scales to handle growing data volumes.
- **Low Latency**: Delivers near-instantaneous processing and results.
- **Event Driven**: Triggered by incoming data events, ensuring continuous operation.

#### Technologies Used
- Common tools include **Apache Kafka**, **Apache Flink**, **Apache Storm**, **Google Cloud Dataflow**, and **Amazon Kinesis** for implementing real-time data pipelines.

#### Applications
- **Fraud Detection**: Real-time monitoring to detect fraudulent activities.
- **IoT Applications**: Continuous data analysis from connected devices.
- **Social Media**: Live tracking of user interactions and trends.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Instant evaluation of public sentiment from textual data.
- **Telecommunication**: Real-time network traffic management.
- **Stock Analysis**: Immediate processing of financial data for quick trading decisions

### Sampling in Data Stream

**Sampling in data streams** involves selecting a subset of data points from a continuous flow of data for analysis. Since processing the entire stream may be infeasible due to its size or speed, sampling helps in managing the data more efficiently while maintaining representativeness.

#### Types of Sampling

1. **Random Sampling**: 
   - Each data point in the stream has an equal probability of being selected.
   - Ensures an unbiased sample but may miss specific patterns.

2. **Systematic Sampling**: 
   - Selects every *k*th data point from the stream.
   - Simple to implement but can introduce bias if there is a periodic pattern in the data.

3. **Stratified Sampling**: 
   - The data stream is divided into strata or groups, and samples are drawn from each group proportionally.
   - Ensures all groups are represented in the sample.

4. **Cluster Sampling**: 
   - The data stream is divided into clusters, and a few entire clusters are randomly selected.
   - More efficient for large data streams but may lead to biased results if clusters are not representative.

5. **Weighted Sampling**: 
   - Data points are assigned different probabilities of being selected based on their importance or relevance.
   - Helps in focusing on more significant data points.

6. **Time-Based Sampling**: 
   - Samples are taken at regular time intervals.
   - Useful for time-series data or when consistent time snapshots are needed.

7. **Event-Based Sampling**: 
   - Sampling is triggered by specific events or conditions in the data stream.
   - Effective for capturing data around significant occurrences.

Sampling in data streams allows for efficient data handling and ensures that meaningful insights can still be derived from large volumes of data


### Decaying Window Sampling

**Decaying Window Sampling** is a method used in data streams to give more weight to recent data while reducing the impact of older data. This is achieved by applying a decay factor over time, ensuring that the most relevant data is prioritized for analysis.

#### Working

1. **Data Arrival**:
   - New data points continuously arrive in the stream.
   
2. **Apply Decay**:
   - A decay function is applied to older data points, reducing their weight over time.
   - Common decay functions include exponential decay.

3. **Update Weights**:
   - Each data point's weight is updated based on how much time has passed since its arrival.
   - Recent data points have higher weights than older ones.

4. **Weighted Aggregation**:
   - Aggregations (like averages or sums) are calculated using the updated weights.
   - This emphasizes the importance of recent data in the aggregation results.

5. **Data Expiry (Optional)**:
   - Data points that fall below a certain weight threshold can be removed from the analysis to save resources.

#### Applications

- **Real-time Analytics**: Continuously updating insights based on the most recent data.
- **Financial Markets**: Analyzing recent trends and price movements for quick decision-making.
- **Network Security**: Prioritizing recent network events to detect and respond to threats.
- **Sensor Data**: Monitoring the latest sensor readings for real-time adjustments in IoT systems.

#### Advantages

- **Relevance**: Focuses on the most recent and relevant data.
- **Efficiency**: Reduces storage and computation requirements by de-emphasizing older data.
- **Adaptability**: Quickly adapts to changes in the data stream, making it suitable for dynamic environments
