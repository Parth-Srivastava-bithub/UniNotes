### **Origin of State and Theories**
1. **Evolutionary Theory**:
   - The state developed from the basic social units like family and extended into clans and tribes.
   - Over time, as families and clans grew, they formed larger communities that required more structured governance.

2. **Force Theory**:
   - States emerged when powerful individuals or groups imposed their control over weaker groups through the use of force.
   - This theory suggests that the state is born out of conquest and subjugation.

3. **Mystical Theory**:
   - It proposes that the state is a divine creation, ordained by a higher power or god.
   - This theory is often linked to religious beliefs where rulers are considered as chosen by deities.

4. **Contract Theory**:
   - This theory is based on the idea of a social contract where individuals voluntarily come together to form a state.
   - People agree to surrender some freedoms to the authority in exchange for protection and order.

### **Stages of State Formation**
1. **Primitive Society**: Small family groups or tribes with no formal governance.
2. **Clan System**: Larger family units form clans with informal leadership.
3. **Tribal Society**: Tribes emerge as larger entities with chieftains or elders.
4. **State Formation**: Tribes consolidate under a central authority or king, creating a structured state.

### **Kingship**
- Kingship refers to a monarchy where a king is the central figure of power.
- Kings were often considered to have a divine right to rule and were seen as protectors of their people.

### **Council of Ministers**
- A group of advisors and officials who assist the king in administration and governance.
- These ministers were experts in various fields like defense, finance, and law.

### **Political Ideas**

- Thinkers like Kautilya (Chanakya) contributed significantly with texts like *Arthashastra* on statecraft and governance.

### **Conditions of Welfare Societies**
- Welfare societies focus on providing for the basic needs of all members, ensuring justice, and maintaining peace.
