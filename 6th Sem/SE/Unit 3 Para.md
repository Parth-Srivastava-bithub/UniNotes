### üîß **Objective of Software Design**

1. **Correctness**: Software design must ensure that the system accurately implements the requirements and performs as expected. A system with errors in design will lead to incorrect outputs, affecting the entire functionality.
  
2. **Completeness**: The design should address all the necessary features and functionalities specified in the requirements. Incomplete designs often lead to missing features or mismatches between expected and actual system behavior.
  
3. **Efficiency**: The design should utilize resources such as memory, CPU, and time in an optimized manner. An inefficient design can lead to performance issues, causing the system to lag or fail under heavy load.

4. **Flexibility**: The design should be adaptable to changes in requirements or environment. A rigid design that cannot easily be modified or extended will quickly become obsolete as needs evolve.

5. **Consistency**: Consistency in design ensures that similar elements function the same way across the system. This reduces confusion and potential errors by making the system intuitive for developers and users.

6. **Maintainability**: A good design should be easy to maintain and modify over time, even after the software is deployed. This includes fixing bugs, updating features, and ensuring that changes don't break existing functionality.

### üí° **Good Software Design (GSD)**

1. **Correctness**: A good software design accurately addresses all the user requirements and ensures that all functionalities are delivered without errors. Without correctness, the design can't be considered reliable.

2. **Understandability**: The design should be clear, simple, and easy to understand for both developers and stakeholders. An understandable design facilitates faster development and easier troubleshooting.

3. **Efficiency**: It must make optimal use of resources (e.g., time, memory, processing power) to ensure that the software performs well under various conditions. Poor efficiency leads to slower performance and increased costs.

4. **Maintainability**: The design must be structured in a way that allows for easy modification, updates, or debugging. If the system is difficult to maintain, it may cause significant delays when issues arise or improvements are necessary.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Phases of Software Design**

1. **Interface Design**: Defines the points of interaction between system components or between the system and external users. It should be intuitive, ensuring seamless communication between modules.

2. **Architectural Design**: Focuses on the overall structure of the system, breaking it down into smaller components or modules. The design ensures scalability, maintainability, and efficient resource allocation while adhering to system requirements.

3. **Detailed Design**: Provides a low-level view of each component within the system, detailing the logic and functionality. This phase ensures that each module meets the required specifications, often using algorithms and data structures.

### üéØ **Software Design Principles**

1. **Problem Partitioning/Decomposition**: The process of breaking down a complex system into smaller, manageable components. This helps in focusing on individual parts and reduces complexity.

2. **Abstraction**: Hiding the complex details of a system and exposing only the necessary functionalities. It simplifies interaction with the system by providing clear interfaces and reducing unnecessary complexity.

3. **Modularity**: Dividing the software system into separate modules that perform specific tasks. Each module should have a clear interface, promoting code reusability, maintainability, and separation of concerns.

4. **Top-Down and Bottom-Up Approach**: Top-down design starts with the highest level of abstraction, breaking down the system into smaller modules. Bottom-up design focuses on creating low-level modules first, then combining them to form the overall system.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Modularization**

1. **Modularization**: Dividing a system into distinct modules that can be developed, tested, and maintained independently. This enhances reusability and simplifies system updates.

2. **Benefits**:
   - **Testing and Debugging**: Modularization makes it easier to test and debug smaller parts of the system independently.
   - **Reusability**: Modules can be reused in other projects, saving time and resources.
   - **Extensibility**: New features can be added with minimal disruption to existing functionality.

### üìä **Design Structure Class**

1. **Design Structure Class**: It represents the organization and relationship of modules in a system. This includes how modules interact with each other and how they depend on shared data and control flow.

### üîå **Symbols in Software Design**

1. **Module**: A module represents a component or a functional unit of a system. It encapsulates related functionality and interacts with other modules through well-defined interfaces.
   - **Control Module**: Manages the overall flow and coordination of the system.
   - **Sub Module**: A smaller, more specific part of the system that performs a particular task within a larger context.
   - **Library Module**: Provides reusable functions or services that can be used across multiple modules.

2. **Conditional Call**: Represents decisions within the flow of control, where different paths are followed based on certain conditions.
  
3. **Loop**: Represents a repetitive process within the flow of control, where an action is repeated multiple times until a condition is met.

4. **Data Flow**: Describes the movement of data between modules or components.

5. **Control Flow**: Refers to the sequence in which instructions or operations are executed within the system.

6. **Physical Storage**: Refers to how data is stored physically, such as in databases or files.

### üìä **Structure Chart**

1. **Types**:
   - **Transform Centered Structure**: Modules are organized around a core transformation process.
   - **Transaction Centered Structure**: Modules are designed around specific transactions or events.

2. **Benefits**: Structure charts provide a clear hierarchy of system components, making it easier to understand how different modules interact.

### üß© **Coupling and Cohesion Measures**

1. **Coupling**: Describes the degree of interdependence between modules. Low coupling is ideal as it reduces complexity and increases maintainability.
   - **Data Coupling**: Modules share only necessary data, leading to low interdependence.
   - **Common Coupling**: Modules share global data, which can create a high interdependency, leading to difficult maintenance.
  
2. **Cohesion**: Describes how closely related the tasks within a module are. High cohesion means the module is focused on one task and is easier to maintain.
   - **Functional Cohesion**: The best form of cohesion, where a module performs one task completely.
   - **Coincidental Cohesion**: The worst form, where tasks are unrelated and randomly grouped.
