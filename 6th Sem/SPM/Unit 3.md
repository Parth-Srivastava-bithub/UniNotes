**1. Objectives of Activity Planning**
- **Definition**: It refers to defining the tasks, their order, duration, and resources needed to complete a project.
- **Metaphor**: Like planning a road trip with stops, fuel checks, and meals so you don’t get stranded.
- **Example**: A software project needs front-end design, then back-end coding, and then testing. Planning helps organize them smoothly.

**2. Project Schedules**
- **Definition**: A timeline that assigns start and finish dates to project tasks.
- **Metaphor**: Like a train schedule showing when each train departs and arrives.
- **Example**: Task A starts on Jan 1 and ends Jan 5, Task B follows from Jan 6 to Jan 10.

**3. Activities - Sequencing and Scheduling / Network Planning Models**
- **Definition**: Sequencing is arranging tasks in the correct logical order; scheduling is deciding exact timings.
- **Metaphor**: Like cooking: chop veggies before frying them. You can’t reverse the steps.
- **Example**: In software, login feature must be built before testing login.

**4. Formulating Network Model**
- **Definition**: Creating a visual map of tasks and their dependencies.
- **Metaphor**: Like a flowchart showing how electricity flows from station to houses.
- **Example**: A diagram where nodes represent tasks and arrows show order.

**5. Forward & Backward Pass**
- **Definition**: Techniques to find earliest and latest times each task can start or finish without delaying the project.
- **Metaphor**: Like calculating how early you can leave for a movie and how late you can leave without missing it.
- **Example**: Task A must be done by day 5 for Task B to start on day 6.

**6. Critical Path (CPM)**
- **Definition**: The longest sequence of dependent tasks that determine the minimum duration of a project.
- **Metaphor**: Like the main highway in a road trip – any delay here delays the whole trip.
- **Example**: Tasks A → B → C take 5, 3, and 2 days. This 10-day chain is the critical path.

**7. Risk Identification**
- **Definition**: Recognizing potential problems that might affect the project.
- **Metaphor**: Like checking for potholes or fuel leaks before starting a long journey.
- **Example**: Risk: Developer might leave mid-project.

**8. Assessment - Risk Planning**
- **Definition**: Analyzing how severe each risk is and planning how to prevent or handle it.
- **Metaphor**: Like having a spare tire and knowing nearest garages.
- **Example**: If developer leaves, have backup CVs ready.

**9. Risk Management**
- **Definition**: Continuous process of handling risks to keep the project stable.
- **Metaphor**: Like a pilot constantly monitoring turbulence and fuel.
- **Example**: Weekly check-ins to ensure no delays or cost overruns.

**10. PERT Technique**
- **Definition**: Estimation method using optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely time for tasks.
- **Metaphor**: Like predicting your exam result based on best, worst, and average prep.
- **Example**: A task takes 3 (O), 7 (P), 5 (M) days → Expected Time = (3+4*5+7)/6 = 5 days.

**11. Monte Carlo Simulation**
- **Definition**: Running the project model many times with different random inputs to estimate success.
- **Metaphor**: Like playing a game multiple times to see win/loss chances.
- **Example**: Simulating 1000 project timelines to see how often deadline is met.

**12. Resource Allocation**
- **Definition**: Assigning people, tools, and money to project tasks.
- **Metaphor**: Like deciding who in your team will cook, clean, or drive on a trip.
- **Example**: 2 developers on UI, 1 tester, 1 designer.

**13. Creation of Critical Paths**
- **Definition**: Identifying all paths in a task network and selecting the longest one.
- **Metaphor**: Like finding all possible routes in Google Maps, then picking the longest one to avoid.
- **Example**: Task paths A→B→C (10 days) vs. D→E (7 days) → A-B-C is critical path.

**14. Cost Schedules**
- **Definition**: Planning when and where money will be spent throughout the project.
- **Metaphor**: Like setting a budget for each part of your vacation.
- **Example**: Rs.10k in Jan (hardware), Rs.15k in Feb (developer salary).
